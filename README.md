# Retro-Light-Cycle-Game

## Overview
This project recreates the classic **Tron Light Cycle** arcade experience using web technologies. Inspired by my love for Disney's *Tron* movies. 
This game was built as a personal project to strengthen my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.

## Gameplay
The player controls a light cycle using the arrow keys. The objective is to avoid hitting walls or the trails left behind by cycles. The game ends when the player collides with any obstacle. Each victory increases the score, and a new round begins, allowing the score to accumulate until a crash occurs.

## Technical Details
The game runs entirely in the browser using the HTML `<canvas>` element. Key features include:
- **Dynamic rendering** of the playfield grid and cycles.
- **Real-time input handling** for movement controls.
- **Collision detection** for walls and self-trail.
- A simple **game loop** built with `setTimeout` to control animation speed.
- **Rule-based avoidant Ai** for user to battle with


## Tools Used
- **HTML5 (canvas)**
- **JavaScript**

## Future Improvements
- Updated scoring system
- Create levels to go with socring system
